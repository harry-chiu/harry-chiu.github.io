Hello, I'm Harry Chiu.

# About Me

### Introduce

Hello, I'm Harry. I graduated from Shih-Shin University's Department of Asset Management,
specializing in front-end programming of web pages or apps. Before graduation, I completed a
dual-platform native app project in cooperation with the Social Bureau.

Clean code is my insistence. Clean code improves the quality of the program, while poor code slows
down the development efficiency. I always pay attention to and keep the code clean.

My favorite sentence is, "Stand on the shoulders of giants." This phrase reminds me at all times not
to spend time doing what others have done, to move quickly on the road that has been opened, to keep
up with the predecessors.
